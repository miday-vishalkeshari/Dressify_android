# 👗 Dressify: Intelligent Clothing Recommendation System

Dressify is a smart fashion assistant that helps users find the most suitable clothing styles and color combinations based on their **body details**, **skin tone**, and **clothing preferences**. It not only recommends individual outfits but also suggests **matching combinations**—for example, if a user selects a blue upperwear, Dressify might suggest black or beige bottomwear to complete the look.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users provide body details (e.g., height, body type), skin tone, and clothing preferences.
2. **Style Matching**: The system recommends suitable clothing styles based on the input.
3. **Color Coordination**: If a user selects a specific upperwear (e.g., blue shirt), Dressify suggests matching bottomwear (e.g., black jeans).
4. **LLM Reasoning**: An LLM generates natural language explanations and styling tips.
5. **Output**: The user receives a complete outfit recommendation with matching items.
